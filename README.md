We have been tasked with designing and creating a database for a fictional laser tag business.
After creating a logical and physical E-R diagram to depict our database, we created a data dictionary with an entry for each entity in our database. 
After finalising our design, we implemented our database into a Database Management System, populate with sample data, and retrieve data via queries.
